scripts that i use sometimes

while working, i write these kinds of scripts all the time so i can do something easier and quicker.
these are just some of commands and things that i execute to do something:)

I have added `dmenu` to the scripts, so you need to install `dmenu` first in order to be able to go on with some of the scripts:)

    export PATH=$PATH:<path-for-scripts>/

run the above in the terminal for test, add these in the `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` for permanent use:)
